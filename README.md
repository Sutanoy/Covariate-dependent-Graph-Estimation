# Covariate-dependent-Graph-Estimation

There are two demo codes in this repository which showcases the practical performance of the graph estimator proposed in our paper "An approximate Bayesian approach to covariate dependent graphical modeling". The code discrete_covariate_demo.R considers the case of discrete covariates. The code cont_covariate_attempt2.R considers the toy example presented in the paper with continuous covariates. The cov_vsvb.R and ELBO_calculator are functions called by the demo codes. Specifically, the function cov_vsvb updates the variational parameters and returns the converged estimates for a single graph.
